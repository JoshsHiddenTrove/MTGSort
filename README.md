# MTGSort 
to run the project first cd ../MTGSorting 
then rune the command "node CardCalls.js" in your terminal to setup the server for the backend.
Then go to http://localhost:8080/ where the website will be displayed
I have only run it on windows 10 but I see no reason it cannot run on any system
dependencies so far are NodeJS,js, and MTG api
