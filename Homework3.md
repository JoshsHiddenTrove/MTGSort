By this homework I was hoping to Create github repo and then implement the file for continuous integration w/ no tests yet. I didn not antisipated my scope well and finish that
quickly so I moved onto the HMTL and CSS and start with both my front end and back end. So for this assignment I have started my front end and backend and researched how to make
api calls but neither is near completed. 
By the next deadline on optimistically I am expecting to alter my timeline slightly by moving it ahead and having my JS compeltely done and through QA testing and have my frontend
near completion

I am having issues embedding the image of the front end into this document but have it prepared for the interview.
